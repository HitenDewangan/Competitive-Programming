'''
There are n tasks with ith task having A[i] difficulty. Divide these n task among k people. You can only give only some consecutive task to any person. 
Minimize the maximum difficulty given to any individual.
Time taken = sum of all tasks difficulty.


Sample Input
A = [12,34, 68, 90]
k = 2

person = p1, p2
p1 = [12, 34, 68]
p2 = [90]

Sample Output
max time = 12+34+68 = 114 this, is minimum time ,also 114 > 90
